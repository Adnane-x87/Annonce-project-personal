Create a complete, standalone HTML file for the public property listings page using HTML + Tailwind CSS 4 (CDN).

Requirements:
- Public header same as home page (Home link, Properties active, About, Contact).
- No full hero – start directly with search/filter section at top: sticky or prominent filter bar with Price range (min/max inputs), Location input, Property Type dropdown, "Apply Filters" button.
- Main content: responsive grid of property cards (3-4 columns desktop, 2 tablet, 1 mobile) showing approved listings only.
- Each card: large image placeholder, Title, Location, Price (large), short description/teaser, Property Type badge, "View Details" button.
- Show 12 dummy approved listings with varied realistic data (mix apartments, houses, etc.).
- Sidebar on desktop (or collapsible on mobile) for filters if preferred, but inline top bar is fine.
- Pagination controls at bottom (Previous, numbers, Next).
- Empty state if no results (message "No properties match your filters – try broadening your search").
- Fully responsive masonry or grid layout.
- SEO-friendly: <title "Properties for Sale - RealEstate Pro">, meta.
- Accessible cards with alt text, proper headings.
- Clean, modern real-estate style focused on browsing and discovery.
- Include Tailwind CDN.

Output only the full HTML code in a ```html block.
