Create a complete, standalone HTML file for the login page of a real estate agency admin/assistant panel using only HTML and Tailwind CSS 4 (via CDN). 

Requirements:
- Full-screen centered card on a clean background (subtle gradient or light gray).
- Agency logo placeholder at the top (use a simple <div> with text "RealEstate Pro" or an SVG placeholder).
- Form with: Email field, Password field (type=password), "Remember me" checkbox, Submit button labeled "Sign In".
- Link below the button: "Forgot password?" (no functionality needed).
- Clear error message placeholder (e.g., red text "Invalid credentials" hidden by default).
- Responsive: perfect on mobile, tablet, desktop.
- Accessible: proper labels, autofocus on email, ARIA attributes where needed.
- Use modern Tailwind utilities (forms plugin classes like focus:ring, etc.).
- No JavaScript needed.
- Include Tailwind CDN in <head>.
- Clean, professional, minimal design with good contrast and spacing.

Output only the full HTML code inside a ```html code block.
